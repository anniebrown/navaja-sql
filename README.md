# Motto
Every person has a right to a day job. The best way to gain experience and training is by getting out and doing the work that a person feels confident they can do, and the ability to use past employers to find future opportunity is part and parcel of the American dream. The Navaja-API is the backend for a set of tools that will empower workers and employers to help one another out in this way.
